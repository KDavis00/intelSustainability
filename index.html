                     <p>The 386 was built with a higher density of transistors (over 275,000) than any previous chip. To make
                        production economically viable, Intel had to dramatically improve its manufacturing yields, which meant
                        producing more good chips per silicon wafer. This focus on efficiency naturally reduced the amount of raw
                        materials, water, and energy wasted on producing defective products.

                     <p>A major milestone was reached when Intel pledged to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas
                        emissions by 2040. This commitment placed Intel among the more aggressive climate leaders in the tech
                        industry. The company also announced a goal to achieve net-zero upstream Scope 3 emissions by 2050,
                        acknowledging the environmental impact of its entire supply chain.

                     <p>Intel achieved a significant milestone, reaching 99% renewable electricity use worldwide. This
                        accomplishment was a result of its long-term strategy to invest in a portfolio of renewable energy
                        sources, including direct purchases, on-site generation, and renewable energy credits. This progress puts
                        the company well on track to meet its goal of sourcing 100% of its global electricity from renewable
                        sources by 2030.
